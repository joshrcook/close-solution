# Close.io Solution

**I made a mistake, and I want to apologize.**

My last solution was hurried, and my application was declined for obvious reasons.

I failed to address one of the key performance problems in the project.  And for that I sincerely apologize.

But I can't just apologize and not present a better solution.  

So that's what I've created here.  A *much improved* solution.

Please have a look - I'd love your thoughts, especially in the context of an interview ðŸ™‚.

## Thoughts about the solution

### Typescript usage

I chose to implement Typescript on this project to more closely simulate my normal working environment and to allow me another bug-reducing mechanism.  I find that Typescript alerts me to bugs before they make it into production on a regular basis, so Typescript usage just makes sense.  I'd love to have a conversation about statically typed languages that compile to Javascript in the future (ReScript comes to mind here), but I still believe that Typescript is the best type-checking option that the Javascript ecosystem currently has to offer for a variety of reasons.

### Performance concerns

Something I quite honestly missed in my first submission (albeit, it was a somewhat hurried attempt) was that the individual list items were all rerendering any time I selected a particular list item.  In this attempt, I've corrected that a couple of ways - namely with the use of [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) as a performance enhancement to reduce rerenders combined with passing necessary information via data attributes as suggested by the official React docs [here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html#example-passing-params-using-data-attributes).  After making this update and using React Profiler to verify the results, I'm happy to say that the large list rendering is no longer causing any performance issues when changes are made to a single element.

### Styling

I felt the use of the [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) is a great choice for naming classes and I have used it throughout my career.  Although I know this is only a small project, at scale components named using only BEM-style names are susceptible to class naming collision. That being said, I've impelemented CSS Modules and the [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) library (the only library I used outside of React and ReactDOM).  I think this is a big step in the right direction and strikes a great balance between usable, BEM-style class names that are still collision resistant and scale well with the project.  On a bigger project I may consider using TailwindCSS (one of my favorite libraries out there) for even more efficient CSS.  (Why do I think Tailwind is even more efficient?  Just ask - I'd love to chat about it.)

### Bundling

Bundlers bring a lot of baggage with them.  I'm sure anyone who has been in the frontend world for long can sympathize with the struggles to get an optimized bundle from Webpack 3.  In this project I chose to keep it simple and use the Parcel bundler.  This isn't what I would have chosen for an enterprise-level project because of flexibility concerns, but it does a great job of giving me the tools I need (React bundling, PostCSS, CSS Modules) out of the box, a great HMR system, a built-in server, and then it just steps out of the way like it's not even there.  That made it a no-brainer for this particular project.

### Unit testing

In order to make this project more true to what I would expect a well-implemented solution to contain, I've also added tests for each of the components within the project using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).  These, along with some customization to allow testing to proceed outside of the confines of the Parcel bundler (namely a custom babel and jest config) allowed me to implement these tests without issue.

### Why forward refs in the components if I wasn't using refs anywhere?

I've built my fair share of React apps, and I would say that in almost every case there was a future issue that required me to forward refs to a component I'd already built.  After going through that exercise enough times I've learned my lesson and now in any *component* that I build where I don't know how it will be used in the future.  Just good practice in my book without any penalties that I'm aware of.

### Why pass through the className prop in components if it's not used?

This is the learnings from another mistake I've seen made way too often - components being built without the ability to pass through the className prop.  This is removing functionality that should be there for any component ever built.  The developer using the component should be able to decide if they'd like to add a className at the very least to the top level of the component.  This is another thing that makes good, future-proof code in my opinion.
